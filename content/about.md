Hi, I am Suraj K Suresh a computer science under-grad at Amrita Vishwa Vidhyapeetham. I also play CTF's as a part of [teambi0s](https://twitter.com/teambi0s). My main interests include Reverse Engineering, Fuzzing and Malware. Rest of the time, I enjoy binge watching anime and playing games.

You can contact me on twitter or drop a mail at [kssuraj15@gmail.com](mailto:kssuraj15@gmail.com).

Thanks for dropping by :)
